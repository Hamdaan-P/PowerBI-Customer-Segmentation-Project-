üìä Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
Project Overview
This project utilizes a sample customer dataset to perform a comprehensive Customer Segmentation analysis. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their Income and Spending¬†Score, allowing the marketing team to tailor strategies for acquisition, retention, and revenue growth.

The dashboard, built entirely in Power BI, is a single-page interactive report that transforms raw data into actionable business intelligence.

Key Metrics (KPIs)
The analysis is grounded in the following core metrics:

Metric	Value	Insight
Total Customers	1,000	The sample size for the segmentation analysis.
Avg. Spending Score	51	A neutral average, suggesting room for improvement in driving customer engagement and spending.
Avg. Annual Income	$90,000 (0.09M)	Represents the mean earning power of the customer base.
Total Revenue	$492K	Total revenue generated from the last purchase amount.

Core Business Insights & Segmentation
The main insight is derived from the Income vs. Spending Score scatter plot, which clearly defines four strategic customer segments:

Segment	Quadrant	Characteristics	Strategic Action
The V.I.P.s	Top-Right	High Income and High Spending Score. These are the most profitable, highly engaged customers.	Focus on Retention and Loyalty Programs to keep them engaged.
Underperformers	Bottom-Right	High Income but Low Spending Score. They have the money but are not spending it with us.	Target with personalized marketing and special promotions to drive their Engagement up.
Potential Growers	Top-Left	Low Income but High Spending Score. They are value-conscious but prioritize spending; highly loyal when satisfied.	Focus on Retention and value-added services; nurture them toward higher price points.
At Risk	Bottom-Left	Low Income and Low Spending Score. The least valuable segment.	Utilize low-cost engagement or focus resources on the higher-value segments.

Secondary Findings:
Demographic Balance: The customer base is nearly evenly distributed across Male, Female, and Other genders, and across all major age groups, suggesting no single demographic group dominates spending behavior.

Purchase Categories: The distribution of preferred categories (Clothing,¬†Groceries,¬†Electronics) is also balanced, confirming that segmentation by Income/Score is more effective than by purchase preference alone.
